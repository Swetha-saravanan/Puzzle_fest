  <div class="pre-div"><pre class="about-pre">Solutions of puzzles often require the recognition of patterns and the
  adherence to a particular kind of ordering. People with a high level of inductive
  reasoning aptitude may be better at solving such puzzles than others. But puzzles
  based upon inquiry and discovery may be solved more easily by those with good deduction
  skills. Deductive reasoning improves with practice. Mathematical puzzles often involve
   BODMAS. BODMAS is an acronym and it stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication,
   Addition and Subtraction. In certain regions, PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents,
   Multiplication, Division, Addition and Subtraction) is the synonym of BODMAS.
   It explains the order of operations to solve an expression. Some mathematical
   puzzles require Top to Bottom convention to avoid the ambiguity in the order of
   operations. It is an elegantly simple idea that relies, as sudoku does, on the requirement
  that numbers appear only once starting from top to bottom as coming along.</pre></div>
